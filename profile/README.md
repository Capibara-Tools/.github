## About
### The Mission
Capibara is designed to make C documentation more accessible to developers, academics, and students by lowering the barrier to entry for understanding and writing in C.

### What is Capibara
Capibara introduces a new C library documentation standard, a repository containing crowdsourced documentation based on the new standard, and tooling such as the website and plugins that utilize the new documentation.

Below is list of the various aspects of Capibara:
| Tool | Description |
| -- | -- |
| [Capibara CAPI](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/capi) | A repository containing crowdsourced C library documentation formatted in a new human and machine readable standard for  built on YAML. |
| [Capibara Processor](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/capibara-processor) | Tooling that ingests the Capibara CAPI and formats it for distribution to IDE plugins and other clients. |
| [Capibara Website](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/website) | The website containing important Capibara info, links, resources, and more. Also provides a nice UI for traversing the Capibara CAPI documentation. |
|**Various Capibara Plugins** | These are various IDE and text editor plugins that support providing intellisense, documentation, hover-based keyword lookup, and more based on the Capibara CAPI documentation. Currently: [Capibara VS Code Plugin](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/capibara-vs-code), [Capibara VIM Plugin](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/capibara-vim), [Capibara Emacs Plugin](https://github.com/Capibara-Tools/capibara-vim) |
